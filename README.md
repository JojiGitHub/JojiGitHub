## Hi there 👋

I'm Rohit, a high schooler interested in AI and its application to data science and neuroscience.

### Research
- Designed a project based on the neuroscience principle of active inference as an application to autonomous navigation, finding that it was highly effective

### What I'm Learning Right Now
- Understanding how to use [RxInfer](https://rxinfer.com/) (especially for my research)
- Developing my understanding of machine learning models through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitshenoy88)
