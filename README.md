## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Rohit, a high schooler interested in AI and its application to data science and neuroscience.

### Current and Previous Research
- Designed a project based on the neuroscience principle of active inference as an application to autonomous navigation, finding that it was highly effective
- Currently creating a project centered on using active inference and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in combination to create a less computationally intensive but also more accurate way to understand how prescribed drugs affect the brain under Alzheimer's disease

### What I'm Learning Right Now
- Understanding how to use [RxInfer](https://rxinfer.com/) (especially for my research)
- Developing my understanding of machine learning models through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rohitshenoy88)
